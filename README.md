# Yugen-Project
Open source project that acts as a bridge for early stage software engineers into the tech industry by collaborating and building projects to increase technical capabilities, team work and engineering confidence

Yūgen (幽玄) is an important concept in traditional Japanese aesthetics. The exact translation of the word depends on the context. In the Chinese philosophical texts the term was taken from, yūgen meant "dim", "deep" or "mysterious". In the criticism of Japanese waka poetry, it was used to describe the subtle profundity of things that are only vaguely suggested by the poems, and was also the name of a style of poetry (one of the ten orthodox styles delineated by Fujiwara no Teika in his treatises).

Yūgen suggests that which is beyond what can be said, but it is not an allusion to another world.[11] It is about this world, this experience. All of these are portals to yūgen:

"To watch the sun sink behind a flower clad hill.

To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return. To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands. To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds.

And, subtle shadows of bamboo on bamboo." Zeami Motokiyo

In the context of Technology and Software Engineering Yūngen could be interpreted as the invisible potential and boundless energy that engineers bring along with them into a new discipline. 

The founding engineers of this project struggled at some point to enter the technology industry due to "lack of experience". 

Yūngen is translated as the value that modern organisations sometimes fail to see in early career engineers.
